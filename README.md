# PistonRedstoneStopper
Prevents any kind of redstone logic.  Can't use levers, pistons, redstone torches, etc.

## When to use
Are you tired of people making ~~lag machines~~ instead of **32bit computers**? Do this as a first strike against them till you set something better up.

Like machines stopping at a specific tps. But that takes time... So use this for now! :D
